                         ping_restart members to struct Connected.

- [ProMIND] [2022/03/16] openvpn/client/cliproto.hpp: tun_connected() assigns
                         received_options topology, cipher, ping and ping_restart
                         to corresponding ClientEvent::Connected members.

Changelog 3.7.3 AirVPN - Release date: 8 March 2022 by ProMIND

- [ProMIND] [2022/03/08] client/cliconnect.hpp: Error::N_PAUSE and Error::N_RECONNECT are not
                         signaled and counted as errors anymore. This prevents the confusing
                         and odd error condition signaled by OpenVPN3 in case of pause, resume
                         and reconnection events.

                         the runtime version values directly taken from the respective
                         SSL library functions instead of using the "lazy and highly
                         questionable" hard coded string at compile time provided by
                         the master branch.

Changelog 3.6.6 AirVPN - Release date: 7 December 2020 by ProMIND

- [ProMIND] [2020/11/02] openvpn/ssl/proto.hpp: IV_CIPHERS is set to the overridden cipher only
                         (both from client and/or OpenVPN profile) in order to properly work
                         with OpenVPN 2.5 IV_CIPHERS specifications. The old method of cipher
                         overriding by means of negotiable crypto parameters is still supported
                         in order to maintain compatibility with OpenVPN < 2.5.0
- [ProMIND] [2020/11/24] openvpn/ssl/proto.hpp: added "data-ciphers" directive to profile config
                        .ovpn files in order to comply to OpenVPN 2.5 negotiable data cipher
                         specifications. In case "data-ciphers" is found in the .ovpn file IV_CIPHERS
                         is assigned to the algorithms found in "data-ciphers". In this specific case,
                         "cipher" directive is meant as a fallback cipher and, if not already specified
                         in "data-ciphers", is appended to IV_CIPHERS

                         cleared and recreated with just one item containing serverOverride
- [ProMIND] [2020/05/23] client/ovpncli.cpp: parse_config() In case portOverride or protoOverride is set,

                         to assign the override protocol to all items in remoteList
- [ProMIND] [2020/05/23] openvpn/client/cliopt.hpp: ClientOptions() now calls
                         remote_list->set_transport_protocol_override() instead of
                         remote_list->handle_proto_override()
